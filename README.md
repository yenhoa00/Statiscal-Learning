# Statiscal-Learning

From my interest in the hospitality services industry and my career goal, I would like to do a project about analysing and exploiting 
the most information from the data provided by famous short-term renting service Airbnb. It was established in 2008 and has since become 
a well-known distinct housing and hospitality services that is an online platform for visitors to book accommodations in houses, flats, 
and hotels for a variety of time periods. 
Furthermore, a person may rent out only a part of their home where they live with a lower cost to those in need.
